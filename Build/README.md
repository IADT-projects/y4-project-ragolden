## Build

To install the application to a headset, a few pre requisites must first be achieved.

First, download the Oculus desktop app, and connect your Oculous Quest 2 headset to it.
Second, download the unofficial sideloader app called SideQuest.
Third, enable developer mode on your Oculus Quest to allow installation of external apk files.

With your Oculous Quest powered on and connected to a computer VIA link cable, open Sidequest and select "Install APK from folder on computer" from the menu-bar on top of the application. Navigate to the downloaded apk and and double click it to install it to your Oculous Quest.

In the Oculus Quest main menu, open the app library and select the drop down menu on the top right. From the dropdown menu, select "Unknown Sources" and the newly installed apk should be on the top of the list. Click on it to launch the game.
